New function : "transform piece" to change the piece into background (as gb only support a limited of sprite). Just debug Tetris with bgb and you'll see

It is still difficult because bloc is only considered as only 1 location, but not as a metasprite

Would be easier to code if the bloc was only 1 tile * tile

As a matter of fact, you can't yet :

- create a 2nd line
- colide correctly on left / right



I think I took the wrong direction using the metasprite.

As for now, I will go back to make a tetris with simply 1 bloc.


Each piece would have 4 independant bloc moving together.
